## Notes

- The backend must be running **before** opening the frontend.
- If the database is corrupted or missing, re-run `node db/seed.js` from the `server/` directory.
- JWT tokens expire after 24 hours. Log in again if redirected to `/login`.
- Light/dark theme toggle is available in the sidebar.
